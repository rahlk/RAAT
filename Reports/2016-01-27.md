## Deltas: XTREES
 - Y-AXIS: Increase/Decrease (as a fraction: +ive -> Increase; -ive -> Decrease; 0 -> No Change)
 - X-AXIS: Features
 

### Remarks:
 - Recommended changes differ with data sets. For instance:
  1.  NPM (Number of Public Methods): Increases in ANT, decreases in IVY, no change in the other three.
  2.  LOC (Lines of code): Needs to be increased(??) in LUCENE.
  3.  AMC (Average methods per class): Needs to be increased in ANT and POI (and by a large amount!)
  4.  CBO (Coupling between objects): To be increased in POI, but decreased in ANT and IVY
  5.  RFC (Response for a class): Needs to be increased by a large amount (x87) in JEDIT. And almost no other changes required.
  6.  CAM (Cohesion among methods of a class): Needs to increased in ANT and POI (no surprises here).
 - Several of these changes are counterintuitive but necessary to reduce defects.

### My 2 Cents:
1. Making these changes may increase code smells: LOC -> LargeClass; CBO -> Feature Envy. 
2. This may mean that all code smells are not necessarily bad? Evidence of code smells and their effects have so far been only anecdotal. 
3. Perphaps, presence/abscence of code smells have different effects on different projects. We may not need to always refactor all code smells, in some cases these may increase the defects, as evidenced here.
